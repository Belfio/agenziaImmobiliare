### Sustainability Innovation Manager tasks:

Main tasks for the Sustainability Innovation Manager using GL1:

1. Baselining emissions
1. Setting objectives
1. Emissions monitoring

#### Baselining emissions

Baselining emissions is about establishing an accurate starting point for measuring the carbon footprint of a bank's mortgage portfolio, which is currently a challenge due to data limitations and the use of imprecise proxies.

1. **Requirement for starting setting the strategy**: It's the first step in the process of managing and reducing emissions related to mortgages. Having an accurate baseline is crucial for banks to set realistic objectives, design effective green lending products, and measure the impact of their sustainability initiatives.
2. **In need of accurate data**: Currently, banks are struggling to get accurate data for this baseline:
   - They have Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) data for about 64% of properties.
   - For properties without EPCs, they use estimates and averages based on similar properties in the area.
3. **Improving the proxies**: The current methods are imprecise, which makes banks uncomfortable about setting specific emissions reduction targets.
4. **Regulatory push**: There's a push towards getting more accurate data, either through regulation or self-regulation within the industry. Banks are looking for ways to get direct measurements, such as through smart meter data, to improve the accuracy of their baseline emissions calculations.

The platform will create a sophisticated portfolio analysis using ML, with retrofit levers prioritised on a property-level depending on user-defined targets, constraints and business rules
There is a precision delta

#### Setting objectives

Setting objectives for a Sustainability Innovation Team involves defining clear, measurable goals that push the bank towards greater sustainability in its mortgage portfolio, while navigating data challenges, regulatory expectations, and practical limitations.

1. **Defining sustainability goals**: This involves working with the Group Policy team or senior sustainability officers to establish specific, measurable targets for reducing emissions or improving sustainability in the mortgage portfolio.
2. **Aligning with overall group targets**: The objectives need to fit within the bank's broader sustainability commitments, such as net-zero by 2050 or other interim targets.
3. **Dealing with data uncertainty**: The team must set targets despite having incomplete or imprecise baseline data. This can be challenging and may require using proxies or estimates.
4. **Balancing ambition and feasibility**: Objectives need to be ambitious enough to make a meaningful impact, but also achievable given the bank's current capabilities and resources.
5. **Considering different approaches**: For example, NatWest chose to set a target based on EPC ratings (aiming for half of their properties to be at EPC C or above) rather than specific emissions reductions due to data limitations.
6. **Anticipating future regulations**: The team needs to consider potential upcoming regulations or industry standards when setting objectives.
7. **Planning for measurement and verification**: Objectives should be set with consideration for how progress will be measured and verified over time.
8. **Designing product strategies**: The targets inform the development of green lending products and initiatives to help achieve the sustainability goals.
9. **Considering financial implications**: The team needs to balance sustainability objectives with the bank's financial goals and risk management.
10. **Stakeholder engagement**: Setting objectives may involve consulting with various departments within the bank, as well as external stakeholdes or regulators.
11. **Timeframe consideration**: The team needs to set both short-term and long-term objectives, potentially with interim milestones.

The platform will provide information on potential objectives, including hypothetical costs based on the latest retrofit commercial data.

The automated platform helps quickly set achievable goals and understand requirements to meet objectives.

Define mortgage portfolio implications of high-level group targets. Iterate with group policy team to define specific sustainability-linked objectives (from a feasibility point of view) inc. right metrics
Imprecise data increases the risks of miscalculations and unrealistic objectives, as well as increased risk of greenwashing

Greening the built environment
Reducing
emissions will require decarbonisation
of the electricity grid, along with
increased uptake of low carbon heat
technologies and energy-efficiency
measures and supply chain upskilling
and expansion. Many policies to aid
reductions have significant risks in
delivering reductions required.

Key recent policy developments relevant to achieving
our buildings decarbonisation targets

The UK has a commitment to achieve

### Dashboard

**Good practices**

- Having 1 main KPi that the user can check everytime they logs. It should be something very clear, simple and linked to the platform mission
  - Ex. in Google Analtics you have the number of users visiting your website
- Having a set of other linked KPIs that explain the main KPI
  - Ex. in Google Analytics you have the list of most clicked pages in your website and the main sources of the users and the main region the users belong to
- Good practice to have some sort of filters: Overall and regional.
  - Ex. in Google analytics you can set the time period
- Being a data driven platform, a lot of enphasis goes into explaining the data, where it comes from and how things are measured.
- One main CTA and a few other smaller CTAs in the page

#### Main KPI Proposal #1:

Estimated Emissions from the Mortgage Portfolio / Target

1. Direct relevance: It directly relates to the core mission of reducing carbon emissions in the built environment.
1. Regulatory focus: As mentioned in the conversation, banks are increasingly required to report on and reduce their financed emissions, particularly in their mortgage portfolios.
1. Comprehensive metric: This KPI encapsulates the overall impact of all green lending initiatives and retrofits.
1. Target alignment: It aligns with the high-level targets that banks are setting, such as "Net Zero by 2050."
1. Actionable: Changes in this metric can drive decision-making across various aspects of the bank's operations and lending strategies.
1. Comparability: It allows for easy comparison across time periods and potentially between different banks or portfolios.

This KPI could be displayed prominently at the top of the dashboard, possibly with a large number showing the current total emissions, a trend line showing changes over time, and a clear indication of progress towards the bank's emissions reduction target.

#### Main KPI Proposal #2:

Average EPC Rating of the Mortgage Portfolio

Here's why this could be an excellent alternative:

1. Tangible metric: EPC ratings are well-understood in the industry and provide a tangible measure of energy efficiency.
1. Regulatory alignment: As mentioned in the conversation, some banks (like NatWest) are already setting targets based on EPC ratings rather than direct emissions.
1. Data availability: Banks often have more complete EPC data than precise emissions data, making this metric more immediately actionable.
1. Customer-facing: EPC ratings are familiar to homeowners, making it easier to communicate the impact of green lending products to customers.
1. Direct link to property value: Improving EPC ratings can increase property values, aligning sustainability goals with financial benefits.
1. Clear improvement pathway: Each step in the EPC rating (e.g., from D to C) represents a concrete improvement, making progress easy to visualize and understand.
1. Proxy for emissions: While not a direct measure of emissions, EPC ratings serve as a good proxy for the energy efficiency and, by extension, the carbon footprint of properties.

#### Journey

When the Sustainability Innovation Manager lands in the Dashboard, their work will mostly be to:

- check the Main KPI (emission info and EPC) to understand the state of the portfolio
- check the dynamic of the main KPI in a chart to see that nothing weird happened in the past

- also, if first time platform user - get a sense of how much the platform has to offer, i.e.:
  1.  EPC chart
  1.  Portfolio data general info
  1.  data quality general info
  1.  News from GL1 and webinars
  1.  Insights - a few lines
  1.  Target list
  1.  Compliance alert
- also, if a target is set - get an understanding of:
  - financial cost of greening the portfolio
  - opearative cost of greening the portfolio
  - Predictive monitoring and timelines
- if a target is not set - CTA
- if a targe is set, what should be the main CTA?? <<<<===============
